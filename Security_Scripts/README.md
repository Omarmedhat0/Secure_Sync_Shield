## Overview

Secure Sync Shield provides robust encryption mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality during file operations. It leverages AES for efficient content encryption and RSA for securely managing encryption keys. Integrated with Firebase, it enables seamless and scalable file storage and database management.

------

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption**: Utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting file contents and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) for encrypting AES keys, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Firebase Integration**: Facilitates secure file storage and retrieval using Firebase Storage, and manages update flags efficiently via Firebase Database, enabling real-time synchronization.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implements comprehensive logging using Python's `logging` module, capturing detailed events and errors for enhanced debugging and audit capabilities.

------

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before deploying Secure Sync Shield:

- Python 3.x
- Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON file
- RSA public and private keys for encryption operations

------

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure Secure Sync Shield:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/yourusername/Secure_Sync_Shield.git
   cd Secure_Sync_Shield
   ```

2. **Firebase Setup**:

   - Place your Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON file in the `Securityscripts` directory.

3. **RSA Keys**:

   - Store your RSA public and private keys in the `Securityscripts/Keys` directory for encryption and decryption operations.

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```
   bash
   Copy code
   pip install firebase-admin cryptography
   ```
